# Polygon Operations Web Application

This is a React-based web application that allows users to manage and perform spatial operations (union and intersection) on GeoJSON polygon feature collections. The application utilizes [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) and [JSTS](https://github.com/bjornharrtell/jsts) for spatial analysis and geometry operations.

## Features

- **Multiple Polygon Solutions:** Users can switch between different sets of polygon solutions to explore and modify.
- **Polygon Selection:** Users can select polygons from the map by clicking on them.
- **Union Operation:** Combines two selected polygons into one, merging their areas.
- **Intersection Operation:** Finds the common area between two selected polygons.
- **Area Calculation:** Displays the total area of selected polygons.
- **Map Visualization:** Visualize polygons on an interactive map using [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).
