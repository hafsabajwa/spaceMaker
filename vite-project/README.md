# Polygon Operations Web Application

This is a React-based web application that allows users to manage and perform spatial operations (union and intersection) on GeoJSON polygon feature collections. The application utilizes Turf.js and JSTS for spatial analysis and geometry operations.

## Features

- **Multiple Polygon Solutions:** Users can switch between different sets of polygon solutions to explore and modify.
- **Polygon Selection:** Users can select polygons from the map by clicking on them.
- **Union Operation:** Combines two selected polygons into one, merging their areas.
- **Intersection Operation:** Finds the common area between two selected polygons.
- **Area Calculation:** Displays the total area of selected polygons.
- **Map Visualization:** Visualize polygons on an interactive map using React Leaflet.
